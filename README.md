Swap Two Numbers Without Extra Space
This repository demonstrates how to swap two numbers using arithmetic operations without additional space. It’s a simple, space-efficient algorithm that's easy to implement.
A basic C++ Program where we can swap two numbers (Integers) without using extra space in memory using arithmetic operations 
Benefits
	No Extra Space: Swaps numbers without temporary variables.
	Simple: Easy to understand and implement.
